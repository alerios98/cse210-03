# Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the
# letters of a secret word one at a time. It operates very similarly to Hangman.


# GAME SPECIFICATIONS:

# - The puzzle is a secret word randomly chosen from a list
# - The player guesses a letter in the puzzle
# - If the guess is correct, the letter is revealed
# - If the guess is incorrect, a line is cut on the player's parachute
# - If the puzzle is solved the game is over
# - If the player has no more parachute the game is over

# Run 'main.py' to begin the game.
